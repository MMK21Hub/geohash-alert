# Geohash Alert

> 📍🏡 Notifies you when today's [geohash](https://geohashing.site/geohashing/Main_Page) is near your house!

**Geohash Alert** is a web app that automatically sends you a push notification if there's a daily geohash ([What is Geohashing?](https://geohashing.site/geohashing/Main_Page)) near (e.g. within walking distance to) your home (or any other location you choose).

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.com) and a monorepo structure (using Bun workspaces). The server uses Hono.
